# flask-app

The Dockerization of an application is nothing but simply taking your application code and embedding it into a Docker image and run within a Docker container (container is to image what object is to class, i.e; an instance).
Prerequisites: Docker + Kubernetes.
If you donâ€™t have them, I would suggest to download docker-desktop, which is easy to download and run. You can download from the link for mac, windows.
